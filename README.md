# Network Automation with Ansible

This repository contains Ansible playbooks for automating network tasks on Cisco IOS devices. The playbooks perform various tasks such as configuring interfaces, managing VLANs, saving and backing up configurations, and gathering device facts.

## Prerequisites

1. Ansible installed on your control machine.
2. `ansible` and `netmiko` Python libraries installed.
3. SSH access to the Cisco devices.
4. An inventory file with device details.

## Setting Up the Inventory File

Create an inventory file (`hosts`) with details of the devices you want to manage.

## Creating playbooks to play along. You can find the playbooks that I have used in playbook directory.
